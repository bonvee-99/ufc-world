# UFC Stats and Fights

---

## Overview:

This application is for a user to interact with a UFC world. The user will be able to create their own fighters
and generate fights between their own fighters or between other ones. They will also be able to look at current fighters 
and their stats. Anyone who is interested in the UFC or likes to look at players' stats wil enjoy this.

This project is of interest to me because I myself enjoy watching the UFC. I have also played many games where you can
create your own player. Although this application is not exactly a simulation of the real life UFC, it allows you to 
play around and interact with other pre-made fighters, and the ones that you created yourself.
